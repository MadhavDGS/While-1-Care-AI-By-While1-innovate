## Testing

### Sample Test Images
The repository includes a `TestImages` directory with sample medical images for testing various analysis features:

- Brain MRI scans for tumor detection
- Eye images for diabetic retinopathy analysis
- Skin condition images
- Lung X-rays
- Blood report samples
- And more...

You can use these images to test the system's analysis capabilities without needing to upload your own medical images initially. These images are provided for demonstration purposes only.

### How to Use Test Images
1. Navigate to the appropriate analysis section in the application
2. Instead of uploading your own image, use one from the `TestImages` directory
3. Test different analysis features with relevant sample images
4. Review the AI's analysis and generated reports

Note: These test images are carefully selected examples and are meant for demonstration purposes only. Real medical analysis should be performed with actual patient images.
